## Summary

This app will show you what places to visit and what to see when visiting a certain city or surrounding area, in Northern New Mexico.
The surrounding "Highlights" of that city will appear. "Highlights" being points of interest, historical markers, churches,
or even just a great restaurant! The user will be able to find some of the most interesting and highly recommended
places to visit and see in the great wilderness and cities of Northern New Mexico! 

My app will use input from the user and turn it into pictures of places to see, as well as a description of the places as well.


## Intended users

* Users will be an out-of-state visitor, visiting Northern New Mexico and wanting some good advice as where to go.
> As an out-of-state visitor, I want an app that I can use to look up new places to go and explore, when hiking.
> When visiting a certain place and the phone does not service, having a trail map downloaded on the phone from the app beforehand when phone did work.


* Northern New Mexico people needing a place to go where they have never been.
> As a resident of Northern New Mexico wanting to find a new point of interest I've never seen, I want an app that helps me locate new places in my area.
> As an explorer, wanting to find a hot spring or waterfall would be useful to have an app with directions, pictures, and maps.

* Local people who are in need of a quick and fast in state getaway!
> As a resident of New Mexico, I want an app that gives me new places to explore in the Northern region of New Mexico to help me get away from the city! 
> Back country places that are not easily assessable, finding them through this app will be great!

## Server component

### Functionality

* The app would provide information on the point of interest, and name typed in and surrounding area. Pictures and descriptions of places would also be provided. 
You would be able to search your destination with a map, and find a point of interest.


### Persistent Data

* The user will be able to use a map and be directed to the surrounding area for that place, as well as places of interest in the surrounding area.
I personally would like to have a point of interest, for all the places I know! 

### External services

* So the user will also have a link, if the particular place where they are going has one, to access.
